        "input": "Context: A 56-year-old CMV-seronegative female with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis received a double lung transplant from a CMV-seronegative donor (D−/R−) in August 2018. Prophylaxis was initiated with valganciclovir, and 6 months after transplantation, the patient developed a breakthrough CMV primary infection (pneumonitis and plasma viral load of 142,000 IU/mL) (Fig. 1A). Subsequent treatment with ganciclovir failed, and a genotypic resistance study performed by Sanger sequencing showed the L595S mutation in the UL97 gene (IC50 × 8.5–9.2; which confers a 8.5- to 9.2-fold decreased susceptibility to ganciclovir/valganciclovir) (7). Treatment with foscarnet combined with CMV-specific immunoglobulin and everolimus controlled the patient’s symptoms. After CMV infection was resolved, the patient started secondary prophylaxis with foscarnet and specific immunoglobulin weekly, which was maintained for approximately 5 months until nephrotoxicity forced the discontinuation of foscarnet. As a result, secondary prophylaxis with LMV (480 mg/24 h) was initiated. CMV load at the time of LMV secondary prophylaxis was 7,740 IU/mL. A 39-year-old CMV-seronegative male with alcoholic liver cirrhosis received a liver transplant from a CMV-seropositive (D+/R−) donor in February 2021. The patient was administered primary prophylaxis with valganciclovir for 4.5 months, which was discontinued due to severe neutropenia (Fig. 1B). One year after transplantation, he developed gastrointestinal CMV disease (detected in biopsy) which was treated with valganciclovir until being discontinued due to neutropenia. The patient then developed CMV retinitis that required treatment with ganciclovir/valganciclovir. Fifteen months after transplant, he developed SARS-COV-2 pneumonia complicated by a pulmonary superinfection with Pneumocystis jirovecii and CMV. Valganciclovir was administered until being replaced with foscarnet due to neutropenia. After clinical and virological response (35 IU/mL), secondary prophylaxis with LMV (480 mg/24 h) was initiated. After 5 weeks of LMV administration, asymptomatic low-grade viral replication (229–1,230 IU/mL) was detected, but LMV was maintained for 4 months. Plasma CMV replication gradually increased until viral load reached 60,000 IU/mL. \n Question: What is the Patient Type with respect to the drug Valganciclovir",

Thorough diagnostic workup  in the ER included abdominal X-rays, an abdominal and  pelvic CT scan without IV contrast and an abdominal and  pelvic CT scan with IV contrast were completed during  these 4 visits. On the images of CT scan with IV contrast,  mucosal thickening and submucosal edema of the transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon were noted (Figure 1).  No definite explanation for this CT finding or explanation  of her symptoms was identified in the emergency room. When she was seen by the PCP for follow up 2weeks  later, she was continuing to experience left lower quadrant  abdominal pain. The pain fluctuated in severity, seemed to  be random in nature, but may have been slightly improved  with bowel movements. She continued to have intermittent  loose stools.

        "input": "Context: A man in his 40s presented to our primary care clinic for insomnia due to patient restlessness that occurred almost every night for three weeks, awakening him from sleep most nights. Our first step was to evaluate the cause of this patient’s insomnia. The differential diagnosis for insomnia is broad but was easily narrowed down in this patient’s case because of his lack of past medical history. Because this patient only experienced symptoms for three weeks, which is less than the three months required for a chronic insomnia diagnosis, his diagnosis was that of acute insomnia. The social determinants of health for our patient included working a nighttime job and living at home with parents. His body mass index (BMI) was 18.10 kg/m2 , and he had a normal vitamin B12 level at 496 pg/mL (normal range: 200-1,000 pg/mL), a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level at 2.16 mU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mU/L), and a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study.

        "input": "Context:  Here we report a 24-year-old female who presented with nephrotic range proteinuria. Initial blood investigations revealed a doubtful autoimmune disease background. A subsequent renal biopsy revealed membranous nephropathy with both PLA2r and exostosin 1 positivity, which posed challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Immunoglobulin G staining and electron microscopy were performed to differentiate if it was a PLA2r-associated or a exostosin 1/ exostosin 2-related membranous nephropathy. Electron microscopy revealed subepithelial deposits and immunoglobulin G stained for immunoglobulin G4, signifying possible PLA2r-associated membranous nephropathy with exostosin deposits. The patient was treated with rituximab and had a good treatment response. Only one similar case has been reported with both PLA2R and exostosin positivity. The pathophysiologic mechanism of this unique association is still unclear. The 24-year-old female was reportedly in good health until June 2021, when she experienced abdominal pain and burning during urination for a week. She was admitted to a private hospital for four days and treated for pyelonephritis. Throughout this period, there were no signs of reduced urine output, nausea, vomiting, facial puffiness, or leg swelling. Her renal function remained normal during this time (Table 1). Treatment included intravenous piperacillin and gentamicin for three days before being discharged. In October 2021, she developed facial puffiness over the course of a week and was subsequently diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome (Table 1). A renal biopsy was recommended, but she declined at that time and was lost to follow-up for about nine months. During this interval, she self-medicated with furosemide tablets. Her medical history did not include alopecia, photosensitivity, fever, oral ulcers, joint pain, swelling, skin rashes, hematuria, or native medication use. She reported experiencing oligomenorrhea and had been married since June 2022. There were no similar complaints within her family. \n Question: What is the Patient Type with respect to the drug Rituximab",

        "input": "Context: We report about a man in his mid-50s who was prescribed pregabalin (150mg/day) for neuropathic pain due to a herniated intervertebral disc. Four weeks later, he presented to the emergency room with symptoms consistent with delirium. After ruling out acute intoxication with a substance and neurological causes, collateral information from the family and review of his medical chart indicated potential discontinuation syndrome owing to pregabalin. Following the successful treatment and resolution of delirium, the patient revealed he had been consistently consuming pregabalin doses upwards of 2 g/day over the past 2 weeks, leading to the premature exhaustion of his prescription and an abrupt cessation. The case findings underscore the necessity for physicians to recognise the potential for pregabalin misuse and the associated withdrawal risks, including delirium  \n Question: What is the Patient Type with respect to the drug pregabalin",
